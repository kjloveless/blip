### kilo like text editor

##### currently works on posix (like) systems, may get around to windows support eventually

i wanted to build a simple text editor and learn zig

make sure you have zig 0.13.0 and run zig run src/main.zig from the root

you can also run zig build from the root, which will produce a binary in
zig-out/bin/
